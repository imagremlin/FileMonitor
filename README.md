# FileMonitor

Simple file monitor for Windows. 

It will send an eMail notification if the monitored file size has not changed between checks. For instance if the period is set to five minutes, the notification is sent if the file has not changed size in five minutes.

Useful for people who needs to leave large files processing (such as renders) to know their file is ready.
